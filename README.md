# Network Congestion Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting network congestion using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze network traffic data and identify potential bottlenecks to enhance performance and ensure efficient data flow.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for network traffic data.
- Implementation of multiple ML models to predict congestion.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualizations to interpret model performance and feature importance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Congestion_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results.
